# WhatsApp Chatbot with ChatGPT API Integration and Database storage
This project is a WhatsApp chatbot that leverages the ChatGPT API, utilizing tailored 'system' instructions to suit specific business needs. The code utilizes OpenAI's API, employing the 'gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct' language model to generate responses based on information provided in the 'system' instructions.

Additionally, the chatbot has the capability to store relevant information in a database for future reference and analysis.

**Please note that this chatbot is intended for testing purposes and is built using free APIs with limited run time. For commercial use, API fees will need to be paid.**
